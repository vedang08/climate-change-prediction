# Climate Change Prediction
An efficient model to predict the temperature of Rio De Janeiro with Berkeley Earth dataset using Time Series Forecasting.

Please read the attached [notebook](https://github.com/vedang08/climate-change-prediction/blob/main/climate-change-forecast-sarima-model.ipynb) for more details.

Results:  
The baseline RMSE for the test baseline was 1.02 celsius degrees  
The baseline RMSE for the test extrapolation was 0.63 celsius degrees  
An improvement of 37.96%  

Thanks!
